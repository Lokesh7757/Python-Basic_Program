Problem Statement

A String Motor is a device that takes a string S and a value K from the user as input and returns a string as an output. The output string is the string obtained by rotating the input string by k characters in the backward direction.

For example, if the input string is "doselect" and k is 2, then the output string would be "selectdo".

# Input string and integer K
S = input().strip()
K = int(input().strip())

# Rotate the string by K characters backwards
result = S[K:] + S[:K]

# Output the result
print(result)
